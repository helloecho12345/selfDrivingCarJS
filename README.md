# Self-Driving Car with JavaScript Course – Neural Networks and Machine Learning

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs_rAxEsAvI

Learn how to create a neural network using JavaScript with no libraries. In this course you will learn to make a self-driving car simulation by implementing every component step-by-step. You will learn how to implement the car driving mechanics, how to define the environment, how to simulate some sensors, how to detect collisions, and how to make the car control itself using a neural network.

The course covers how artificial neural networks work, by comparing them with the real neural networks in our brain. You will learn how to implement a neural network and how to visualize it so we can see it in action.
